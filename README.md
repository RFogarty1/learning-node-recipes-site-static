Static site generator which creates a basic recipes site from an sqlite3 database. Main purpose was to help me learn some html/css/javascript/nodeJS.

By default its set to use a simple toy database, but this can be changed in src/config\_vars.js.

To create the site just run "node create\_site.js", then run a live server in the newly created "build" directory
